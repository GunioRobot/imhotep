This is a Python package for playing with the
`Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/>`_ web framework.
Currently the goal of the project is to create an application that allows 
one to register a user account, upload an image and be able to perform simple 
manipulations like crop, scale and rotate.
